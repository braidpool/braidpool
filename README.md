# Proposal

Read the [complete proposal](proposal/proposal.pdf).

The pool provides:

1. Lower variance for independent miners, even when large miners join
   the pool.
2. Miners build their own blocks, just like in p2pool.
3. Payouts required a constant size blockspace, independent of the
   number of miners on the pool.
4. Provide building blocks for enabling a futures market of hash rates.

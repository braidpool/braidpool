# Proposal

Read the
[proposal](https://github.com/pool2win/braidpool/raw/main/proposal/proposal.pdf)
for braidpool.

For details on how delivering shares to market makers for enabling hashrate
futures, read the blog post: [Deliver Hashrate to Market
Markets](https://blog.opdup.com/2021/08/18/deliver-hashrate-to-market-makers.html).

The goals of the pool are:

1. Lower variance for independent miners, even when large miners join the pool.
2. Miners build their own blocks, just like in p2pool.
3. Payouts require a constant size blockspace, independent of the number of
   miners on the pool.
4. Provide building blocks for enabling a futures market of hash rates.

# Running the node

For the moment, the node runs a simple p2p broadcast. To run it you need to do
the usual cargo things

```
cd node
cargo build

# run the first seed node on port 8989
cargo run -- --bind=localhost:8989

# run another node while specifying their own port as 9899 and pointing to the seed node
cargo run -- --bind=localhost:9899 --addnode=localhost:8989

```

# Progress

The [project on github](https://github.com/wholooks/braidpool/projects/1)
tracks the main components to build. Here's a list to keep us focused:

- [ ] P2P gossip based broadcast of miner blocks and shares.
- [ ] Use FROST rust implementation for providing threshold schnorr
      signatures. Use mock clock for identifying rounds.
- [ ] A DAG of shares to track contributions for miners.
- [ ] Validate received blocks and shares.
- [ ] Single script installer (limited to Linux variants, potentially using
      docker).

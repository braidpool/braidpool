* What do want to observe?

  - Percentage of shares that miners aren't rewarded for.
  - Mean propagation time of shares.

* How do we want to get to that observation?

  - We'll need to simulate the p2p network with gossip broadcast
    - Building shares
      - Include only the 'root' nodes from the dag
    - Counter based forwarding
    - Anti-antropy to fetch shares missing from dag
    - Build a dag of shares
    - On finding a block (random event)
      - calculate the reward and track which shares miners didn't get
        rewarded for.

* Variables

  1. Random topolgy and latencies for each run. Not a variable.
  2. Vary the
     1. Share period
     2. The block finding interval
     3. Size of the network

* Components to build [1/4]

  1. [X] Share construction
     1. [X] Include the roots of the trees in the DAG forest.
  2. [-] Broadcast
     1. [-] Handle receive message
        1. [X] Should we forward it?
        2. [X] If so, forward it.
        3. [X] For received dependencies, insert received in DAG
        4. [ ] Else [WONTDO]
           1. [ ] send request for missing depdendency
              1. [ ] send request for missing share using exponential back-off
           2. [ ] add others to dag
     2. [ ] [WONTDO] Send request for missing shares
     3. [X] Generate shares at frequency of ``share period''
     4. [X] Send shares
     5. [X] Add test to verify BroadcastPipes are FIFO
  3. [ ] Block discovery by a node
     1. [ ] Reward attribution
        1. [ ] Track which shares by each peer will be rewarded when
           the block is discovered.
  4. [-] Trace/log system
     1. [X] Send timestamp
     2. [X] Receive timestamp at all nodes
     3. [ ] Block discovery
        1. [ ] Timestamp of block discovery
        2. [ ] Last share received from each peer
